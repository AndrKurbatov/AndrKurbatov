            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>My name is Andrii. I was born in the 5 th of May, 1992 in Poltava, which is the town of Ukraine.
                I am twenty-six years old.
                Let me tell you about my hometown.
                Poltava — one of the most interesting towns of Ukraine — is situated on the picturesque bank of the
                river Vorskla.</p>

            <p>Poltava was first mentioned in chronicles as Ltava in 1174. This old name changed only in 1430. The
                history of Poltava is full of different events.
                Since 1569 it was a part of Poland. And only in 1667 it became a part of Russia. The town is also
                well-known thanks to Poltava battle,
                when Peter the Great with his army defeated the Swedish army of Karl XII.</p>

            <p>The Ukrainian writer Kotlyarevsky wrote about Poltava in his works. Poltava and its region is also
                connected with the name of M. V. Gogol, who described its landscapes in his stories.
                Now Poltava is a modern town and a regional centre. Machine-building, metal-working, food and light
                industries are well developed there. It is also a large railway junction.

                Poltava has many scientific-research institutes and 5 higher educational establishments.
                There are two theatres — the Ukrainian Music and Drama Theatre and the Puppet Theatre, and the
                Philharmonic Society in the town.</p>

            <p>The centre of the old city is a semicircular Neoclassical square with the Tuscan column of cast iron
                (1805-11), commemorating the centenary of
                the Battle of Poltava and featuring 18 Swedish cannons captured in that battle. The five-domed city
                cathedral, dedicated to the Exaltation of the Cross,
                is a superb monument of Cossack Baroque, built between 1699 and 1709. Another frothy Baroque church,
                dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos,
                was destroyed in 1934 and rebuilt in the 1990s.

                The Museum of Regional Studies is one of the oldest in Ukraine, it was founded in 1891.
                There are more than 136 thousand displays, including unique collections of Ukrainian carpets, national
                costumes and antique weapon.</p>

            <p>Not so long ago I graduated from the Poltava National Technical University in the direction of
                preparation of economic cybernetics.
                Throughout my entire period of study, I have made the most of my desire to gain professional skills in
                the economic and technical fields,
                as a result I received a Master's degree with honors.</p>
