                    <h1>Let me tell you about my hometown</h1>
                    Poltava — one of the most interesting towns of Ukraine — is situated on the picturesque bank of the
                    river Vorskla.
                    Poltava was first mentioned in chronicles as Ltava in 1174. This old name changed only in 1430. The
                    history of Poltava is full of different events.
                    Since 1569 it was a part of Poland. And only in 1667 it became a part of Russia. The town is also
                    well-known thanks to Poltava battle,
                    when Peter the Great with his army defeated the Swedish army of Karl XII.</p></div>

                    The centre of the old city is a semicircular
                    Neoclassical square with the Tuscan column of cast iron
                    (1805-11), commemorating the centenary of
                    the Battle of Poltava and featuring 18 Swedish cannons captured in that battle. The five-domed city
                    cathedral, dedicated to the Exaltation of the Cross,
                    is a superb monument of Cossack Baroque, built between 1699 and 1709. Another frothy Baroque church,
                    dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos,
                    was destroyed in 1934 and rebuilt in the 1990s.
